                <h1> Question Mark</h1>
            </section>
            <p class="content">There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that
                are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these the one but the first and the
                most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is
                all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected
                with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a
                question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as
                it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.
                Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the
                ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a
                question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when
                it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring
                myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.
                Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary, they are
                ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not
                know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true
                of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and
                quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will
                see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.
                So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly
                obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and
                these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them.
