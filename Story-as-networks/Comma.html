						<br></br>
						I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.
						<br></br>
						As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.
						<br></br>
						When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing. 
						<br></br>
						Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do.
						<br></br>
						Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean.
						<br></br>
						When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.
						<br></br>
						So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so and later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.

						逗号是做什么的。

						我是如此频繁地拒绝他们，并把他们遗漏了很多，并且不断地没有他们，以至于我终于对他们无动于衷了。我现在不在乎您是否放入它们，但很长一段时间以来，我对它们绝对感到肯定，并且与它们无关。

						正如我所说的逗号是奴役的，他们没有自己的生活，使用不是一种用途，它是一种代替自己的兴趣的方式，我确实喜欢在我所做的事情中喜欢自己的兴趣我自己的兴趣。通过逗号帮助您为您穿上外套并穿上鞋子，可以使您免于过上应有的积极生活，多年以来，对我来说，直到现在我仍然不这样做，我仍然有这种感觉尽管对它们的重视程度很高，但对它们的使用却在积极地降低了性能。让我告诉你我的感受，我的意思，我的感受和我的意思。

						当我写《美国人的形成》的那些长句子时，动词活跃的现成动词带有较长的从属状语从句对我来说是一种激情。我告诉过你，我认识到动词和副词在介词和与代词连词的辅助下拥有整个写作的活跃生命。

						复杂性最终是为了简单起见，因此我一直喜欢从属状语从句。我喜欢从属状语从句，因为它们具有多种依赖性和独立性。您会看到，逗号会降低这些事物的复杂程度，这是多么令人垂涎。为什么如果您希望将精力集中在过度复杂化的最终简单性上，而又希望通过任何人工帮助实现这种简单性呢？您现在看到我为什么对这种简单性感到满意了吗？你现在明白我为什么会这样了吗
						像我一样和我一样。

						想一想您真正想做的任何事情，您就会明白我的意思。

						当您真的很难解开纠结而不是割开结时，至少任何人都会感觉到谁正在使用任何线程，因此任何人都会感觉到谁正在使用任何工具，因此任何人都会感觉到谁正在编写任何句子或在句子之后阅读它。已经写了。逗号的作用是，逗号什么都不做，只是使事情变得简单，如果您足够喜欢它，那么不用逗号就足够容易了。冗长而复杂的句子应该强迫您自己，使您知道自己和逗号，最多来说，逗号是一个贫穷的时期，您可以停下来喘口气，但是如果您想喘口气，则应该知道你自己想喘口气。并不是说完全停止与继续进行有关，而是好好呼吸，您总是在呼吸，为什么要强调一种呼吸而不是另一种呼吸。无论如何，这就是我对此的感觉，我对此非常强烈地感到。因此，我几乎从未使用过逗号。句子越长，越复杂，我接连听到的相同种类的词越多，我拥有的越多，我就越感受到他们对自己和自己照顾自己的强烈需求。不帮助他们，并通过用逗号使他们受益。

						这就是我对散文中标点符号的感觉，在诗歌中，标点符号有所不同，但更多的是，以后我将继续探讨。但这就是我对散文中标点符号的感觉。
