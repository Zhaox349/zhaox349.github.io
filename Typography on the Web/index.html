    	<h2>Major Depressive Disorder</h2>
  	</div>

  
  
      <section class="body-text">
<P>Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood. Low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause are common symptoms.[1] Those affected may also occasionally have delusions or hallucinations.[1] Some people have periods of depression separated by years, while others nearly always have symptoms present.[3] Major depression is more severe and lasts longer than sadness, which is a normal part of life.[3]

The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences and a mental status examination.[7] There is no laboratory test for the disorder,[3] but testing may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms.[7] Those with major depressive disorder are typically treated with counseling and antidepressant medication.[1] Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may only be significant in the most severely depressed.[8][9] Types of counseling used include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy,[1][10] and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered if other measures are not effective.[1] Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with a risk of harm to self and may occasionally occur against a person's wishes.[11]

The most common time of onset is in a person's 20s and 30s,[3][4] with females affected about twice as often as males.[3][4] Major depressive disorder affected approximately 163 million people (2% of the world's population) in 2017.[6] The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France.[4] Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world (15%) compared to the developing world (11%).[4] The disorder causes the second-most years lived with disability, after lower back pain.[12]

The term major depressive disorder was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s.[13] The cause of major depressive disorder is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors,[1] with about 40% of the risk related to genetics.[3] Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance abuse.[1][3] It can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health.[1][3] Those currently or previously affected with the disorder may be stigmatized.[14] </P>

    	<h2>1. Symptoms and signs</h2>
  	</div>

<p>Major depression significantly affects a person's family and personal relationships, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health.[15] Its impact on functioning and well-being has been compared to that of other chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes.[16]

A person having a major depressive episode usually exhibits a low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an inability to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. Depressed people may be preoccupied with—or ruminate over—thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness or hopelessness.[17] In severe cases, depressed people may have symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms include delusions or, less commonly, hallucinations, usually unpleasant.[18] Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory (especially in those with melancholic or psychotic features),[19] withdrawal from social situations and activities, reduced sex drive, irritability,[20] and thoughts of death or suicide. Insomnia is common among the depressed. In the typical pattern, a person wakes very early and cannot get back to sleep.[21] Hypersomnia, or oversleeping, can also happen.[21] Some antidepressants may also cause insomnia due to their stimulating effect.[22]

A depressed person may report multiple physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or digestive problems; physical complaints are the most common presenting problem in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization's criteria for depression.[23] Appetite often decreases, with resulting weight loss, although increased appetite and weight gain occasionally occur.[17] Family and friends may notice that the person's behavior is either agitated or lethargic.[21] Older depressed people may have cognitive symptoms of recent onset, such as forgetfulness,[19] and a more noticeable slowing of movements.[24]

Depressed children may often display an irritable mood rather than a depressed one,[17] and show varying symptoms depending on age and situation.[25] Most lose interest in school and show a decline in academic performance. They may be described as clingy, demanding, dependent, or insecure.[21] Diagnosis may be delayed or missed when symptoms are interpreted as "normal moodiness."[17] </p>

    	<h2>Associated conditions</h2>
  	</div>
<p>
Major depression frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric problems. The 1990–92 National Comorbidity Survey (US) reports that half of those with major depression also have lifetime anxiety and its associated disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder.[26] Anxiety symptoms can have a major impact on the course of a depressive illness, with delayed recovery, increased risk of relapse, greater disability and increased suicide attempts.[27] There are increased rates of alcohol and drug abuse and particularly dependence,[28][29] and around a third of individuals diagnosed with ADHD develop comorbid depression.[30] Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression often co-occur.[15] Depression may also coexist with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), complicating the diagnosis and treatment of both.[31] Depression is also frequently comorbid with alcohol abuse and personality disorders.[32] Depression can also be exacerbated during particular months (usually winter) for those with seasonal affective disorder. While overuse of digital media has been associated with depressive symptoms, digital media may also be utilised in some situations to improve mood.[33][34]

Depression and pain often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome can worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.[35]

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating and preventing cardiovascular disorders, which further increases their risk of medical complications.[36] In addition, cardiologists may not recognize underlying depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.[37]

Depression often coexists with physical disorders common among the elderly, such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[38]</p>

    	<h2>2. Cause</h2>
  	</div>

<p>The biopsychosocial model proposes that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a role in causing depression.[3][40] The diathesis–stress model specifies that depression results when a preexisting vulnerability, or diathesis, is activated by stressful life events. The preexisting vulnerability can be either genetic,[41][42] implying an interaction between nature and nurture, or schematic, resulting from views of the world learned in childhood.[43]

Childhood abuse, either physical, sexual or psychological, are all risk factors for depression, among other psychiatric issues that co-occur such as anxiety and drug abuse. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, lack of response to treatment and length of illness. However, some are more susceptible to developing mental illness such as depression after trauma, and various genes have been suggested to control susceptibility.[44]</p>

<div class="heading2">
    	<h2>Genetics</h2>
  	</div>

 <p> Family and twin studies find that nearly 40% of individual differences in risk for major depressive disorder can be explained by genetic factors.[45] Like most psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder is likely to be influenced by many individual genetic changes. In 2018, a genome-wide association study discovered 44 variants in the genome linked to risk for major depression.[46] This was followed by a 2019 study that found 102 variants in the genome linked to depression.[47]

The 5-HTTLPR, or serotonin transporter promoter gene's short allele has been associated with increased risk of depression. However, since the 1990s, results have been inconsistent, with three recent reviews finding an effect and two finding none.[41][48][49][50][51] Other genes that have been linked to a gene-environment interaction include CRHR1, FKBP5 and BDNF, the first two of which are related to the stress reaction of the HPA axis, and the latter of which is involved in neurogenesis. There is no conclusive effects of candidate gene on depression, either alone or in combination with life stress.[52] Research focusing on specific candidate genes has been criticized for its tendency to generate false positive findings.[53] There are also other efforts to examine interactions between life stress and polygenic risk for depression.[54] </p>

<p> Other health problems
Depression may also come secondary to a chronic or terminal medical condition, such as HIV/AIDS or asthma, and may be labeled "secondary depression."[55][56] It is unknown whether the underlying diseases induce depression through effect on quality of life, of through shared etiologies (such as degeneration of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease or immune dysregulation in asthma).[57] Depression may also be iatrogenic (the result of healthcare), such as drug-induced depression. Therapies associated with depression include interferons, beta-blockers, isotretinoin, contraceptives,[58] cardiac agents, anticonvulsants, antimigraine drugs, antipsychotics, and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.[59] Drug abuse in early age is also associated with increased risk of developing depression later in life.[60] Depression that occurs as a result of pregnancy is called postpartum depression, and is thought to be the result of hormonal changes associated with pregnancy.[61] Seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression associated with seasonal changes in sunlight, is thought to be the result of decreased sunlight.[62] </p>

    	<h2>3. Pathophysiology</h2>
  	</div>
<p> The pathophysiology of depression is not yet understood, but the current theories center around monoaminergic systems, the circadian rhythm, immunological dysfunction, HPA axis dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.

The monoamine theory, derived from the efficacy of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, was the dominant theory until recently[when?]. The theory postulates that insufficient activity of monoamine neurotransmitters is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. Firstly, acute depletion of tryptophan, a necessary precursor of serotonin, a monoamine, can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of depressed patients; this suggests that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression.[63] Secondly, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the 5-HTTLPR gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link. Third, decreased size of the locus coeruleus, decreased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, increased density of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, and evidence from rat models suggest decreased adrenergic neurotransmission in depression.[64] Furthermore, decreased levels of homovanillic acid, altered response to dextroamphetamine, responses of depressive symptoms to dopamine receptor agonists, decreased dopamine receptor D1 binding in the striatum,[65] and polymorphism of dopamine receptor genes implicate dopamine, another monoamine, in depression.[66][67] Lastly, increased activity of monoamine oxidase, which degrades monoamines, has been associated with depression.[68] However, this theory is inconsistent with the fact that serotonin depletion does not cause depression in healthy persons, the fact that antidepressants instantly increase levels of monoamines but take weeks to work, and the existence of atypical antidepressants which can be effective despite not targeting this pathway.[69] One proposed explanation for the therapeutic lag, and further support for the deficiency of monoamines, is a desensitization of self-inhibition in raphe nuclei by the increased serotonin mediated by antidepressants.[70] However, disinhibition of the dorsal raphe has been proposed to occur as a result of decreased serotonergic activity in tryptophan depletion, resulting in a depressed state mediated by increased serotonin. Further countering the monoamine hypothesis is the fact that rats with lesions of the dorsal raphe are not more depressive than controls, the finding of increased jugular 5-HIAA in depressed patients that normalized with SSRI treatment, and the preference for carbohydrates in depressed patients.[71] Already limited, the monoamine hypothesis has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public.[72]

Immune system abnormalities have been observed, including increased levels of cytokines involved in generating sickness behavior (which shares overlap with depression).[73][74][75] The effectiveness of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokine inhibitors in treating depression,[76] and normalization of cytokine levels after successful treatment further suggest immune system abnormalities in depression.[77]

HPA axis abnormalities have been suggested in depression given the association of CRHR1 with depression and the increased frequency of dexamethasone test non-suppression in depressed patients. However, this abnormality is not adequate as a diagnosis tool, because its sensitivity is only 44%.[78][79] These stress-related abnormalities have been hypothesized to be the cause of hippocampal volume reductions seen in depressed patients.[80] Furthermore, a meta-analysis yielded decreased dexamethasone suppression, and increased response to psychological stressors.[81] Further abnormal results have been obscured with the cortisol awakening response, with increased response being associated with depression.[82]

Theories unifying neuroimaging findings have been proposed. The first model proposed is the "Limbic Cortical Model", which involves hyperactivity of the ventral paralimbic regions and hypoactivity of frontal regulatory regions in emotional processing.[83] Another model, the "Corito-Striatal model", suggests that abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex in regulating striatal and subcortical structures results in depression.[84] Another model proposes hyperactivity of salience structures in identifying negative stimuli, and hypoactivity of cortical regulatory structures resulting in a negative emotional bias and depression, consistent with emotional bias studies.[85] </p>
