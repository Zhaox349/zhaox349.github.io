        <P>Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood. Low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause are common symptoms.[1] Those affected may also occasionally have delusions or hallucinations.[1] Some people have periods of depression separated by years, while others nearly always have symptoms present.[3] Major depression is more severe and lasts longer than sadness, which is a normal part of life.[3]

The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences and a mental status examination.[7] There is no laboratory test for the disorder,[3] but testing may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms.[7] Those with major depressive disorder are typically treated with counseling and antidepressant medication.[1] Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may only be significant in the most severely depressed.[8][9] Types of counseling used include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy,[1][10] and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered if other measures are not effective.[1] Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with a risk of harm to self and may occasionally occur against a person's wishes.[11]

The most common time of onset is in a person's 20s and 30s,[3][4] with females affected about twice as often as males.[3][4] Major depressive disorder affected approximately 163 million people (2% of the world's population) in 2017.[6] The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France.[4] Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world (15%) compared to the developing world (11%).[4] The disorder causes the second-most years lived with disability, after lower back pain.[12]

The term major depressive disorder was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s.[13] The cause of major depressive disorder is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors,[1] with about 40% of the risk related to genetics.[3] Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance abuse.[1][3] It can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health.[1][3] Those currently or previously affected with the disorder may be stigmatized.[14]</P>

<h2>1. Symptoms and signs</h2>
<br> </br>
<p>Major depression significantly affects a person's family and personal relationships, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health.[15] Its impact on functioning and well-being has been compared to that of other chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes.[16]

A person having a major depressive episode usually exhibits a low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an inability to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. Depressed people may be preoccupied with—or ruminate over—thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness or hopelessness.[17] In severe cases, depressed people may have symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms include delusions or, less commonly, hallucinations, usually unpleasant.[18] Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory (especially in those with melancholic or psychotic features),[19] withdrawal from social situations and activities, reduced sex drive, irritability,[20] and thoughts of death or suicide. Insomnia is common among the depressed. In the typical pattern, a person wakes very early and cannot get back to sleep.[21] Hypersomnia, or oversleeping, can also happen.[21] Some antidepressants may also cause insomnia due to their stimulating effect.[22]

A depressed person may report multiple physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or digestive problems; physical complaints are the most common presenting problem in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization's criteria for depression.[23] Appetite often decreases, with resulting weight loss, although increased appetite and weight gain occasionally occur.[17] Family and friends may notice that the person's behavior is either agitated or lethargic.[21] Older depressed people may have cognitive symptoms of recent onset, such as forgetfulness,[19] and a more noticeable slowing of movements.[24]

Depressed children may often display an irritable mood rather than a depressed one,[17] and show varying symptoms depending on age and situation.[25] Most lose interest in school and show a decline in academic performance. They may be described as clingy, demanding, dependent, or insecure.[21] Diagnosis may be delayed or missed when symptoms are interpreted as "normal moodiness."[17].</p>

<h2> 2. Cause</h2>
<p>Major depression frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric problems. The 1990–92 National Comorbidity Survey (US) reports that half of those with major depression also have lifetime anxiety and its associated disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder.[26] Anxiety symptoms can have a major impact on the course of a depressive illness, with delayed recovery, increased risk of relapse, greater disability and increased suicide attempts.[27] There are increased rates of alcohol and drug abuse and particularly dependence,[28][29] and around a third of individuals diagnosed with ADHD develop comorbid depression.[30] Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression often co-occur.[15] Depression may also coexist with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), complicating the diagnosis and treatment of both.[31] Depression is also frequently comorbid with alcohol abuse and personality disorders.[32] Depression can also be exacerbated during particular months (usually winter) for those with seasonal affective disorder. While overuse of digital media has been associated with depressive symptoms, digital media may also be utilised in some situations to improve mood.[33][34]

Depression and pain often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome can worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.[35]

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating and preventing cardiovascular disorders, which further increases their risk of medical complications.[36] In addition, cardiologists may not recognize underlying depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.[37]

Depression often coexists with physical disorders common among the elderly, such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[38]</p>
