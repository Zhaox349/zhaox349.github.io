						<h1> Question Mark</h1>
					</section>
					<p class="content" style="height:400px; width:700px;overflow-y: scroll;">There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that
						are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these the one but the first and the
						most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is
						all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected
						with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a
						question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as
						it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.
						Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the
						ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a
						question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when
						it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring
						myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.
						Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary, they are
						ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not
						know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true
						of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and
						quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will
						see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.
						So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly
						obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and
						these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them.

						有些标点符号很有趣，有些标点符号却没有。让我们从不是的标点开始。其中，第一个也是最完全没有意思的是问号。当它单独用作牛头上的商标或可以用于装饰但与文字联系在一起时，问号完全没意思。显然，您提出的问题是您提出的问题，但是任何能看懂的人都知道问题是书面形式的问题。

						因此，我问你为什么应该使用问号。另外，它的形式不适合普通印刷，因此它既不悦耳又不悦耳，因此它就像一个名词，只是某些东西的不必要名称。一个问题就是一个问题，任何人都可以知道一个问题就是一个问题，那么当问题已经存在于写作中时，为什么要在它已经存在的问题上添加问号。因此，我永远无法自己使用问号，我总是发现它确实令人反感，现在很少有人使用它。

						感叹号具有相同的难度，也有引号，它们是不必要的，它们是丑陋的，它们破坏了书写或印刷的线条，并且无论如何用途，如果您不知道问题是一个问题，那是什么？使用它是一个问题。报价也是如此。当我第一次开始写作时，我发现根本不可能使用问号，引号和感叹号，现在任何人都可以看到它。也许有一天他们会以其他方式看到它，但任何人都不会并且确实会以这种方式看到它。
